# Document 1: How 3D3D Works

## A Plain-Language System Explainer

This document explains exactly what happens when you use 3D3D. No jargon. No hidden mechanics. If you read this and still have questions about how the platform works, contact us and we'll update this document.

---

### What 3D3D Actually Is

3D3D is a Canadian print service platform. We connect people who need objects printed with people who can print them. We also sell digital design files from creators who list with us.

We are not a social network. We are not a marketplace in the traditional sense. We are a service provider with a curated catalog.

### What Happens When You Upload a File

When you upload a 3D model file to get a print quote:

1. **File received**: Your file is uploaded to our secure servers hosted in Canada.

2. **Analysis**: Our system analyzes the file for printability — dimensions, complexity, potential issues.

3. **Quote generation**: Based on the analysis, we calculate material costs, print time, and labor to generate a price.

4. **Your decision**: You see the quote. You decide whether to proceed. No obligation.

5. **If you order**: Your file is assigned to a qualified printer in our network. They print it, perform quality control, and ship it to you.

6. **If you don't order**: Your file is retained for 30 days in case you return. After 30 days, it is automatically deleted. You can request immediate deletion at any time.

### What We Do With Your Files

**We DO:**
- Store files securely to fulfill your order
- Analyze files to provide accurate quotes
- Share files with the specific printer fulfilling your order
- Retain files temporarily for your convenience

**We DO NOT:**
- Sell your files to anyone
- Use your files to create competing products
- Share your files beyond what's needed to fulfill your order
- Keep your files indefinitely without your consent
- Train AI models on your uploads

Your file is your file. We handle it to provide you a service. That's it.

### How Printing Actually Happens

When you order a print:

1. **Assignment**: Your order is assigned to a printer in our network based on:
   - Material availability
   - Printer capability
   - Geographic proximity (for shipping efficiency)
   - Current workload

2. **Production**: The printer produces your part according to specifications.

3. **Quality control**: The printer verifies the print meets standards before shipping.

4. **Shipping**: The part is packaged and shipped to you via tracked carrier.

5. **Delivery**: You receive your part. If there's a problem, you contact us.

We take responsibility for the entire process. If something goes wrong at any step, we fix it or refund you. You don't negotiate with printers. You deal with us.

### Where Responsibility Lies

**3D3D is responsible for:**
- Quote accuracy
- Printer vetting and quality standards
- Order fulfillment
- Customer support
- Refunds and replacements when we fail
- Data handling and privacy

**You are responsible for:**
- Ensuring you have rights to print the file you upload
- Providing accurate shipping information
- Understanding the limitations of 3D printing
- Using printed parts appropriately

**The printer is responsible to us for:**
- Meeting quality standards
- Accurate execution of orders
- Timely completion

You don't manage the printer relationship. We do.

### When We Say No

We refuse orders when:

- The file appears to infringe someone else's intellectual property
- The object is a weapon or weapon component
- The object is unsafe for 3D printing (certain medical devices, electrical components)
- The complexity exceeds our network's capability
- The request violates our terms of service

Refusal is not negotiable. We explain why when possible and appropriate.

### How File Deletion Works

**Automatic deletion:**
- Quote files not ordered: 30 days after upload
- Completed order files: 90 days after delivery
- Account closure: 30 days after closure

**On-demand deletion:**
- Request via account settings or support
- Processed within 7 days
- Confirmation provided
- Irreversible once complete

**What deletion means:**
- File removed from all active storage
- File removed from backups within 30 days
- Metadata retained for accounting/legal compliance only
- No recovery possible after backup deletion

### How This Protects You

The system is designed so that:

- Your files are not exploited
- Your data is not sold
- Failed orders are our problem, not yours
- Your privacy is maintained
- You can leave at any time with your content

### How This Protects Designers

Designers who list files for sale are protected because:

- We vet users before they can purchase commercial licenses
- We track sales and pay royalties accurately
- We respond to infringement reports
- We don't compete with designers using their own work
- We don't claim rights we weren't granted

The system is designed for everyone to benefit from honest transactions.

# Document 2: Print-as-a-Service vs Marketplace

## Why the Distinction Matters

Many platforms call themselves "marketplaces." We don't. This isn't marketing differentiation — it's a legal and structural reality that affects how we operate and what responsibilities we hold.

---

### What a Marketplace Is

A typical online marketplace:

- Connects buyers and sellers
- Takes a commission on transactions
- Provides infrastructure (payments, discovery, reviews)
- Holds limited liability for what sellers do
- Scales by adding more sellers with minimal oversight

Think eBay, Etsy, Amazon Marketplace. The platform facilitates transactions. The seller is responsible for fulfillment, quality, and compliance.

### What a Service Provider Is

A service provider:

- Delivers a service directly to customers
- Takes responsibility for the outcome
- Maintains quality control over production
- Holds liability for failures
- Scales by expanding capacity, not just adding suppliers

Think a restaurant (not a food delivery app), a law firm (not a lawyer referral site), a print shop (not a printing supplies store).

### Why 3D3D Is a Service Provider

When you order a print through 3D3D:

- You are contracting with 3D3D, not with an individual printer
- 3D3D guarantees the outcome, not the printer
- If the print fails, 3D3D fixes it — you don't chase the printer
- Quality standards are set by 3D3D, not negotiated per transaction
- Pricing is set by 3D3D's algorithm, not by individual sellers

Our printers are contractors fulfilling our service commitments. They are not independent sellers using our platform.

### Legal Implications

This structure matters legally because:

**Liability flows to us**: If a print causes harm, 3D3D is accountable as the service provider. We cannot deflect to "just being a platform."

**We control quality**: We can and do refuse printers who don't meet standards. A marketplace typically cannot control seller behavior to this degree.

**We set terms**: Pricing, timelines, and guarantees are determined by us. Printers accept our terms to participate.

**Consumer protection applies differently**: Service provider regulations differ from marketplace regulations. We're subject to higher standards in many respects.

### Why This Protects Users

As a service provider, we cannot:

- Claim you should have vetted the printer yourself
- Argue that quality issues are between you and the seller
- Abdicate responsibility for failed orders
- Hide behind "we just connect buyers and sellers"

You get one point of accountability: us.

### Why This Protects Designers

For STL sales, we operate more like a traditional retailer:

- We curate what appears on the platform
- We set standards for listings
- We take responsibility for payment processing
- We enforce license terms
- We handle disputes

Designers aren't left to enforce their own rights against anonymous buyers. We provide infrastructure that actually functions.

### What Users Misunderstand

Common misconceptions:

**"It's just like Etsy for 3D printing."**
No. Etsy sellers fulfill their own orders. Our printers fulfill our orders under our standards.

**"I'm buying from the maker."**
You're buying from 3D3D. We contract with makers to fulfill your order. The relationship is ours to manage.

**"If it's bad, I complain to the printer."**
No. You complain to us. We handle it. The printer relationship is internal.

**"The platform just takes a cut."**
We don't take a cut from independent transactions. We charge for our service. The distinction is structural, not semantic.

### Why We're Not a Marketplace

We chose this model because:

1. **Accountability is clear**: No finger-pointing between platform, seller, and buyer.

2. **Quality is controllable**: We can enforce standards, not just suggest them.

3. **Trust is buildable**: Users know what they're getting because we guarantee it.

4. **Legal risk is owned**: We can't hide from responsibility, so we build to minimize it.

5. **Growth is sustainable**: Scaling requires us to actually meet demand, not just list more sellers.

This is harder. It's more expensive. It limits how fast we can grow. We think it's worth it.

### For Payment Processors

This structure means:

- Transaction disputes flow to 3D3D as the merchant of record
- Quality control happens before disputes arise
- Refund policies are consistent and documented
- Fraud patterns are detectible because we control the funnel
- Regulatory compliance is our responsibility, clearly

We're a straightforward service business. The transaction model is simple. The risk is contained.

# Document 3: Is 3D3D Right for You?

## Honest Self-Disqualification

We want appropriate customers, not maximum customers. Here's how to determine if you should use 3D3D — and when you definitely shouldn't.

---

### Who Should Use 3D3D

**You have a specific object you need made.**
You found a design or created one. You need it printed. You don't own a printer or don't want to deal with printing it yourself.

**You need occasional custom parts.**
A replacement component. A custom bracket. A prototype. One-off needs where setting up your own printing operation doesn't make sense.

**You value quality over absolute lowest cost.**
Canadian production with quality control costs more than ordering from overseas factories. If you're willing to pay the premium for reliability, turnaround, and support, we make sense.

**You want clear accountability.**
When you order from us, you know who's responsible. That's worth something to some people.

**You're exploring 3D printing without committing to equipment.**
Before buying a printer, you want to see if printed objects actually solve your problems. We're a reasonable way to test that.

---

### Who Should NOT Use 3D3D

**You need hundreds or thousands of identical parts.**
At volume, injection molding or CNC machining is cheaper, faster, and produces stronger parts. 3D printing is not mass manufacturing.

**Price is your only consideration.**
Overseas print farms and direct-from-manufacturer ordering will beat our prices. They won't match our service, but if service doesn't matter to you, you shouldn't pay for it.

**You print frequently and enjoy the process.**
If you print weekly, own your own equipment. The economics make sense and so does the learning value. We shouldn't be a subscription for something you enjoy doing.

**You need it today.**
Same-day printing is not reliably available. Shipping takes time. If you need something in hours, not days, we cannot help.

**Your object is safety-critical without engineering review.**
We print parts. We don't certify them for structural, electrical, or medical use. If failure means injury, you need engineering validation we don't provide.

---

### When Owning a Printer Is Better

**You print regularly.**
If you're ordering from us monthly, a $400 printer pays for itself within a year using material costs alone.

**You iterate on designs.**
Changing a design, reprinting, evaluating, repeating — this cycle is fast on your own printer. Every print-service iteration adds days.

**You enjoy the process.**
3D printing is a hobby for many people. If you find it interesting, equipment ownership brings satisfaction beyond the objects produced.

**You want material control.**
Home printing lets you experiment with specific filaments, settings, and techniques. Our standardized production can't match that flexibility.

**You're learning CAD or 3D design.**
Rapid feedback from your own printer accelerates skill development. Waiting for service prints slows learning.

---

### When Overseas Manufacturing Makes Sense

**Volume is high.**
Need 500 units? 5,000? Overseas manufacturing is built for this. We're not.

**Unit cost drives your business model.**
If your margins require $2 parts and you're building a product business, go offshore. We cannot compete on that axis.

**Lead time is flexible.**
If you can wait 4-8 weeks vs. 4-8 days, the cost savings of overseas production may justify the wait.

**Quality requirements are standard.**
If you need "good enough" and can absorb some defect rate, high-volume low-cost manufacturing works. We optimize for quality, which adds cost.

---

### When We Will Say No

We refuse orders for:

**Weapons and weapon accessories.**
Firearm components, knives intended as weapons, brass knuckles, prohibited items. Non-negotiable.

**Infringing content.**
Designs that copy protected intellectual property without authorization. We check and refuse.

**Unsafe applications.**
Medical devices requiring certification. Electrical enclosures without rating. Child safety items needing testing. We won't produce items where failure causes serious harm.

**Deceptive purposes.**
Counterfeit goods. Fake badges or credentials. Items intended to mislead or defraud.

**Requests that exceed our capability.**
Size, complexity, material requirements beyond our network's ability. We'd rather decline than underdeliver.

---

### How to Decide

Ask yourself:

1. Do I need one or a few custom things, not hundreds?
2. Am I willing to pay for Canadian production and service quality?
3. Do I lack time, equipment, or interest to do this myself?
4. Is my use case standard (not safety-critical, not weapons)?
5. Can I wait days, not hours?

If all answers are yes, 3D3D probably fits.

If any answer is no, consider the alternatives. We'd rather you choose correctly than choose us incorrectly.

# Document 4: Payments & Processor Readiness

## Why Processors Can Be Confident

This document explains our payment structure, why we've made conservative choices, and why processors can onboard 3D3D with confidence.

---

### Business Model Clarity

**Primary revenue source:** Print services  
**Secondary revenue source:** Digital file (STL) sales  
**Tertiary revenue source:** Business subscriptions

We sell fabrication services and digital goods. We do not operate in high-risk categories:

- Not gambling or gaming
- Not adult content
- Not cryptocurrency or financial services
- Not multi-level marketing
- Not subscription traps
- Not high-ticket sales with delayed delivery

### Transaction Characteristics

**Average transaction value:** $25-150 CAD  
**Median transaction value:** $45 CAD  
**Maximum single transaction:** $2,500 CAD (larger quotes require manual review)  
**Recurring transactions:** Optional business subscriptions, clearly disclosed

Transaction values are modest and predictable. Outliers trigger manual review.

### Dispute Reduction by Design

We reduce chargebacks and disputes through:

**Clear pricing:** All costs shown before checkout. No surprise fees.

**Realistic timelines:** Production and shipping estimates based on actual capability, not optimistic marketing.

**Quality control:** Parts verified before shipping. Problems caught before customer receipt.

**Responsive support:** Issues addressed within 48 hours. Most problems resolved before dispute escalation.

**Generous refund policy:** We err toward refunding rather than fighting. Refunds are cheaper than disputes.

### Monetization Paths We Reject

We do not pursue revenue through:

**Data sales:** User data is not for sale. No adtech integration.

**Dark patterns:** No auto-enrolling subscriptions. No hidden fees. No confusing cancellation flows.

**Aggressive upselling:** Recommendations are relevant, not manipulative.

**Artificial scarcity:** If something is available, it's available. No fake urgency.

**Engagement manipulation:** No gamification designed to create spending habits.

These paths might increase revenue short-term. They increase disputes, chargebacks, and regulatory scrutiny. We don't use them.

### Fraud Detection Capability

Because we control the order funnel:

**Known risk patterns are detectable:**
- Unusual order volume from new accounts
- Shipping address mismatches
- High-value orders with expedited shipping to new addresses
- Pattern ordering across multiple accounts

**Manual review is feasible:**
- Order volume is manageable for human review of flagged transactions
- We can pause and verify before production
- We can cancel and refund suspicious orders before shipping

**Loss is limited:**
- If fraud succeeds, we lose production cost + shipping
- We do not ship high-value goods before address verification
- Digital goods require account verification with email confirmation

### Chargeback Experience (Projected)

Based on business model comparisons, we project:

**Chargeback rate target:** <0.1%  
**Dispute rate target:** <1%

These targets are achievable because:
- Transaction values are low
- Physical goods create delivery evidence
- Refund policy preempts most disputes
- Quality control reduces defect complaints

### PCI Compliance

We use Stripe for payment processing. We do not store:
- Full credit card numbers
- CVV codes
- Cardholder data beyond what Stripe requires

Payment page is hosted by Stripe. Card data never touches our servers.

### Regulatory Posture

We operate under:
- Canadian federal law
- New Brunswick provincial law
- CASL (anti-spam)
- PIPEDA (privacy)

We are not a regulated financial service. We are a straightforward goods and services business operating within standard e-commerce frameworks.

### Why This Should Give Processors Confidence

- Simple business model with modest transaction sizes
- Physical goods create accountability and tracking
- Dispute reduction is designed into operations
- High-risk monetization patterns are rejected by policy
- Fraud detection is feasible at our scale
- Regulatory environment is stable and understood

We are a boring, predictable business. That's the point.

# Document 5: Designer Onboarding Reality Check

## What to Expect If You Sell on 3D3D

This document sets expectations for designers considering listing work on our platform. We'd rather you know the truth upfront than discover it after investing time.

---

### Who Should Sell Designs on 3D3D

**You create original 3D designs.**
We list original work only. Remixes require original creator permission. Infringing content is rejected.

**You understand Canadian market focus.**
Our audience is primarily Canadian. If your goal is global reach, larger international platforms may fit better.

**You're comfortable with our terms.**
70/30 revenue split (you keep 70% of net). Non-exclusive listing. You retain full rights to your work.

**You can meet quality standards.**
Files must be printable. Photos must show real prints. Descriptions must be accurate. We curate, not just host.

**You have patience.**
New platforms grow slowly. Early designers may wait months before significant sales materialize. If you need immediate income, this isn't it.

---

### Who Should NOT Sell on 3D3D

**You want maximum exposure immediately.**
Established platforms have larger audiences. We're building ours. If volume is your priority, start elsewhere.

**You sell designs that infringe others' IP.**
Fan art of licensed characters, replicas of branded products, designs derived from others' work without permission — we don't list these.

**You expect passive income without effort.**
Listing a file is the beginning, not the end. Successful designers market their work, respond to feedback, and update files. We provide infrastructure, not magic.

**You need to control pricing exactly.**
We provide pricing guidance based on complexity and market. You set final price, but we may decline listings priced far outside reasonable ranges.

**You want exclusive relationships.**
We don't do exclusive listings. You can (and should) sell on multiple platforms simultaneously. If you want exclusive partnerships, larger platforms may offer those deals.

---

### How Royalties Actually Work

When your design sells:

1. Customer pays the listed price (example: $10.00)
2. Payment processor takes fee (2.9% + $0.30 = $0.59)
3. Net revenue: $9.41
4. Your share (70%): $6.59
5. Platform share (30%): $2.82

**Payment schedule:**
- Royalties accumulate in your account
- Payouts processed on the 15th of each month
- Minimum payout: $25 CAD
- Balances under $25 roll over (no expiration)
- Manual payout requests available for balances over $100

**Payment methods (at launch):**
- PayPal
- Additional methods coming based on demand

**No hidden deductions:**
What we document is what happens. No "marketing fees," "hosting fees," or undisclosed charges.

---

### What Protections Exist

**Your rights are preserved:**
- You retain copyright to all your work
- You grant us license to display and sell, nothing more
- You can remove listings at any time
- Removal does not affect past sales (buyers keep their access)

**Infringement protection:**
- We respond to reports of your work being copied
- We remove infringing listings within documented timeframes
- We cooperate with legal enforcement
- We don't require you to prove ownership — we give creators benefit of doubt

**Revenue protection:**
- 70/30 split cannot decrease for existing arrangements
- Payment schedules are honored
- Disputes are resolved through documented process
- You receive detailed sales reporting

**Exit protection:**
- You can leave anytime with no penalty
- Your designs are removed upon request
- You receive final payout within 30 days
- We retain no rights after closure

---

### What Expectations Are Set Low

We intentionally set modest expectations because overselling hurts everyone:

**Sales volume:** Most designs sell fewer than 20 copies in their first year. Some sell zero. A few sell hundreds. We cannot predict which.

**Income replacement:** This is not a replacement for employment income for most designers. Treat it as supplementary.

**Traffic:** Our platform is new. Discovery depends on our growth, which takes time.

**Marketing support:** We do not run advertising campaigns for individual listings. You are responsible for promoting your work.

**Feedback volume:** You may receive little to no feedback initially. Low engagement doesn't mean your work is bad — it means we're building audience.

---

### What We Expect From You

**Accurate listings:**
- Dimensions match reality
- Print settings are tested and verified
- Photos show actual prints, not renders alone
- Descriptions are truthful

**Responsiveness:**
- Customer questions answered within 3 days
- Issues addressed constructively
- Feedback incorporated into updates

**Legal compliance:**
- You have rights to everything you list
- No infringing content
- No misleading claims

**Professionalism:**
- No attacking other designers
- No manipulating reviews
- No gaming discovery systems

We enforce these expectations. Violations result in warnings, then listing removal, then account termination.

---

### Final Check

Before listing:

1. Is my work original or properly licensed?
2. Are my files tested and printable?
3. Are my photos honest representations?
4. Am I prepared for slow initial sales?
5. Am I willing to support buyers who have questions?

If yes to all: welcome.

If no to any: wait until you can say yes.

# Document 6: Platform Stability Guarantees

## What Users Can Rely On

This document translates our governance commitments into plain-language guarantees for everyday users.

---

### What Will Not Change

These elements are permanent for as long as 3D3D operates:

**Your data is not for sale.**
We will never sell individual user data to third parties. This is structural, not just current policy.

**You can leave.**
Account deletion remains available. Data export remains available. We will not create artificial exit barriers.

**Pricing is transparent.**
Costs are disclosed before purchase. No fees appear at checkout that weren't shown earlier. This is a design principle, not a marketing promise.

**Designer revenue share does not decrease.**
If you're on 70/30, you stay on 70/30 or better. We will not reduce revenue share for existing arrangements.

**No dark patterns.**
Confusing cancellation flows, auto-enrolling subscriptions, fake urgency, deceptive interfaces — prohibited forever.

---

### What Might Change

These elements may evolve over time:

**Specific prices.**
Material costs change. Shipping rates change. Our prices adjust accordingly. The model (cost + margin) stays stable; specific numbers don't.

**Features and interface.**
We improve the platform. Features are added. Sometimes features are removed. We provide notice for removals.

**Terms of service language.**
Legal requirements change. We update terms. Material changes require 30-day notice.

**Supported payment methods.**
We may add or remove payment options based on availability and cost.

**Geographic availability.**
We may expand or contract where we operate based on regulatory and operational factors.

---

### What Requires Notice

Changes to these areas require public advance notice before taking effect:

| Change Type | Notice Period |
|-------------|---------------|
| Price increases | 30 days |
| Feature removal | 90 days |
| Terms of service changes | 30 days |
| Privacy policy changes | 30 days |
| Designer revenue share reduction | 60 days (and prohibited for existing terms) |
| Account policy changes | 30 days |

Notice means:
- Email to affected accounts
- In-platform notification
- Public announcement
- Clear explanation of what changes and why

---

### What Is Contractually Respected

When you use 3D3D, these apply:

**Order fulfillment:**
If we accept your order and payment, we deliver or refund. No exceptions.

**Purchase access:**
If you bought an STL, you can download it. Access persists for 90 days after account closure (download before closing).

**Data rights:**
You can request export of your data. You can request deletion. We comply within documented timeframes.

**Dispute resolution:**
You have the right to dispute issues. We respond within 10 business days. Escalation paths exist.

---

### How to Verify Compliance

If you believe we've violated these guarantees:

1. Email governance@3d3d.ca
2. Receive acknowledgment within 48 hours
3. Receive substantive response within 10 business days
4. If unsatisfied, escalate to relevant regulatory bodies

We do not use legal resources to suppress legitimate complaints. We cooperate with investigations.

---

### Why This Matters

Platforms change. Companies get acquired. Priorities shift. Policies erode.

These guarantees exist to constrain future 3D3D, not just current 3D3D. By publishing them publicly and building systems that enforce them, we make breaking them harder and more costly.

We're betting that predictability and trustworthiness compound over time. These guarantees are how we place that bet.
