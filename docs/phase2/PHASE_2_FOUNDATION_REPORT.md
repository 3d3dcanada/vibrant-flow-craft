# Phase 2 Foundation Report

**Project:** 3D3D.ca  
**Phase:** 2 (Governance, Economic Transparency, Ecosystem Authority)  
**Date:** January 9, 2026  
**Status:** Foundation Complete  
**Classification:** Public — Suitable for Legal, Investor, and Processor Review

---

# Section 1: Platform Governance Overview

## Purpose

This document establishes the governance structure of 3D3D. It defines who makes decisions, what constraints exist on those decisions, how changes are made, and how accountability is enforced.

This is not aspirational language. It is the operating framework against which all platform actions can be measured.

---

## 1.1 Decision Authority Structure

### Founder Authority

The founder retains final decision-making authority over:

- Strategic direction and business model
- Hiring and organizational structure
- Capital allocation and investment decisions
- Partnership and acquisition decisions
- Emergency operational decisions requiring immediate action

The founder does NOT have unilateral authority over:

- Changes to published user rights (requires notice period)
- Changes to designer compensation structures (requires notice period)
- Removal of published governance documents (requires public explanation)
- Introduction of dark patterns or manipulative UX (prohibited entirely)
- Changes that violate the Ethics Charter (prohibited entirely)

### Operational Authority

Day-to-day operations are delegated to appropriate team members as the organization grows. Operational decisions that do not conflict with governance documents do not require founder approval.

### Community Input

Community input is valued but not binding. Users may provide feedback through:

- Direct communication (email, support channels)
- Public forums when established
- Feedback mechanisms within the platform

Community input influences decisions but does not override governance constraints or business requirements.

---

## 1.2 Constraints on Founder Power

The following constraints are self-imposed and publicly documented to create accountability:

### Prohibited Actions

The founder may never:

1. **Introduce surveillance-based monetization** — User behavior data will not be sold to third parties or used to manipulate purchasing decisions.

2. **Implement engagement manipulation** — No infinite scroll, autoplay, streak mechanics, or artificial urgency designed to exploit psychological vulnerabilities.

3. **Create artificial scarcity** — If something is available, it is available. No fake "only 3 left" or countdown timers on non-time-limited offers.

4. **Hide pricing information** — All costs are disclosed before commitment. No surprise fees at checkout.

5. **Exploit designer dependency** — The platform will not use lock-in tactics, exclusive contracts that prevent designers from selling elsewhere, or punitive terms for leaving.

6. **Make unverifiable claims** — Marketing will not include claims that cannot be substantiated. "Best" and "leading" will not be used without qualification.

7. **Remove user data rights** — Users retain the right to export their data and delete their accounts. This cannot be revoked.

### Constrained Actions

The following require public notice before implementation:

| Action | Notice Period |
|--------|---------------|
| Changes to pricing structure | 30 days |
| Changes to designer revenue share | 60 days |
| Changes to user rights | 60 days |
| Material changes to Terms of Service | 30 days |
| Changes to Privacy Policy | 30 days |
| Sunsetting of features users depend on | 90 days |
| Changes to this governance document | 60 days |

Notice means: public announcement to affected users via email and on-platform notification, with clear explanation of what is changing and why.

---

## 1.3 Policy Change Mechanics

### Standard Policy Changes

1. Proposed change is documented internally with rationale
2. Legal review if the change affects user rights or regulatory compliance
3. Notice period begins (see table above)
4. Change takes effect after notice period concludes
5. Documentation is updated to reflect new policy

### Emergency Policy Changes

In cases of:
- Active security threats
- Legal requirements with compliance deadlines
- Critical bugs causing harm

Changes may be implemented immediately. However:
- Public explanation must follow within 72 hours
- Affected users must be notified directly if identifiable
- The change must still be documented and made permanent through standard process if ongoing

### Rollback Procedures

If a policy change causes significant user harm:
- The change may be rolled back without completing a new notice period
- Users will be notified of the rollback
- A post-mortem will be published explaining what went wrong

---

## 1.4 Economic Governance

### Revenue Allocation Principles

Platform revenue is allocated according to these priorities:

1. **Operational costs** — Infrastructure, services, and fixed expenses
2. **Designer payments** — Owed royalties and revenue shares paid on schedule
3. **Team compensation** — Salaries and benefits
4. **Reserves** — Minimum 3 months operating expenses maintained
5. **Growth investment** — Only after 1-4 are satisfied
6. **Founder compensation** — Last priority

### Pricing Authority

Pricing decisions are made by the founder or designated operational leadership. Constraints:

- Pricing must be internally consistent (similar services at similar prices)
- Pricing must be publicly documented
- Promotional pricing cannot exceed 30 days duration
- Discounts for specific user classes (education, non-profit) must be documented and consistently applied

### Designer Economics

Designer compensation is governed by the Designer Bill of Rights. Key constraints:

- Revenue share percentages can only increase, never decrease, for existing arrangements
- Payment schedules must be honored within documented timeframes
- Payment disputes are resolved via documented process within 10 business days

---

## 1.5 Enforcement and Accountability

### Internal Enforcement

Governance violations are handled internally before external escalation:

1. Incident identified (by team member, user report, or audit)
2. Incident documented with evidence
3. Responsible party identified
4. Corrective action determined
5. Implementation of correction
6. Documentation of resolution
7. Pattern analysis for systemic issues

### External Accountability

Users who believe governance has been violated may:

1. Report via governance@3d3d.ca
2. Receive acknowledgment within 48 hours
3. Receive substantive response within 10 business days
4. Escalate to relevant regulatory bodies if unsatisfied

The platform will cooperate with regulatory inquiries and will not use legal resources to suppress legitimate complaints.

### Transparency Reports

Annually, the platform will publish a transparency report including:

- Number of governance complaints received
- Categories of complaints
- Resolution rates and timeframes
- Policy changes made in response to feedback
- Enforcement actions taken

The first report will be published after 12 months of operation.

---

## 1.6 Amendment Rules

### Amendments to This Document

This governance document may be amended following these rules:

1. Proposed amendment documented with full rationale
2. 60-day public notice period
3. Affected users notified via email
4. Opportunity for written feedback during notice period
5. Final version published with change log
6. Implementation after notice period concludes

### Immutable Provisions

The following provisions cannot be amended:

- The prohibition on selling user data to third parties
- The prohibition on dark patterns
- The requirement for pricing transparency
- The requirement for notice periods on material changes
- User data export and deletion rights

To change these provisions, the platform would need to be reconstituted as a fundamentally different entity, which would require explicit user consent to continue using the service under new terms.

### Version History

All previous versions of this document are archived and publicly accessible. Changes are tracked with dates and explanations.

---

## 1.7 Definitions

**Dark pattern**: User interface design that manipulates users into taking actions they did not intend or would not take if fully informed.

**Material change**: Any change that affects user rights, user costs, or user data.

**Notice period**: Time between public announcement of a change and implementation of that change.

**Governance violation**: Any action by the platform or its representatives that conflicts with documented policies.

**Affected users**: Users whose rights, costs, or experience will change as a result of a policy change.

---

# Section 2: Economic Transparency Whitepaper

## Purpose

This document explains exactly how 3D3D makes money, where the money goes, and why certain revenue opportunities are intentionally rejected.

If you finish reading this and still have questions about platform economics, we have failed.

---

## 2.1 Revenue Streams

3D3D generates revenue from three sources:

### Print Services

When you order a custom print through our platform:

- **Material cost**: Actual filament/resin used, calculated per gram
- **Machine time**: Duration of print at current rates
- **Labor**: Setup, monitoring, post-processing, quality control
- **Shipping**: Actual carrier costs plus packaging
- **Platform margin**: 25-35% of production cost

The platform margin covers:
- Infrastructure and hosting
- Customer support
- Payment processing fees (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction)
- Quality assurance systems
- Business operations

### STL Sales

When you purchase a downloadable design:

- **Designer share**: 70% of net sale price
- **Platform share**: 30% of net sale price

The platform share covers:
- File hosting and delivery
- Payment processing
- Discovery and curation
- Customer support
- Infrastructure

This split is consistent across all designers. Volume discounts for the platform are passed through as reduced platform share, not reduced designer share.

### Business Subscriptions

Businesses pay monthly for:
- Priority queue access
- Volume pricing
- Dedicated support
- Custom material options
- Workflow integrations

Subscription pricing is tiered by volume and published publicly.

---

## 2.2 How Pricing Is Set

### Print Service Pricing

Print quotes are calculated by algorithm:

```
Base cost = (material grams × material rate) + (print hours × machine rate)
Labor cost = estimated handling time × labor rate
Shipping = carrier API quote + packaging materials
Subtotal = base cost + labor cost + shipping
Total = subtotal × (1 + margin rate)
```

Margin rates vary by:
- Material complexity (standard materials: lower margin; specialty materials: higher margin)
- Order size (larger orders: slightly lower margin percentage)
- Urgency (rush orders: higher margin)

All pricing variables are documented and available upon request.

### STL Pricing

Designers set their own prices. The platform provides:
- Suggested price ranges based on complexity
- Warnings if pricing is unusually high or low for category
- No minimum or maximum price requirements

The platform does not manipulate search results based on price.

### Why Prices May Change

Prices change when:
- Material costs change (passed through proportionally)
- Shipping carrier rates change (passed through directly)
- Operating costs change significantly (trigger margin review)
- New equipment reduces production costs (triggers price reduction review)

Price increases for existing services require 30-day notice.

---

## 2.3 What We Don't Monetize

### User Data

User data is not sold. Period.

We do not:
- Sell browsing behavior to advertisers
- Sell purchase history to data brokers
- Sell email addresses to marketers
- Monetize analytics beyond internal improvement

User data exists to provide service. It is not a product.

### Artificial Urgency

We do not charge for:
- "Priority" placement that is actually default
- "Featured" listings with no organic option
- Removing artificial limitations

If a limitation exists on free tiers, it exists for operational reasons, not to create pressure.

### Lock-In

We do not charge for:
- Data export
- Account deletion
- Moving designs to other platforms
- Removing files from our service

Your content, your data, your choice. Always.

---

## 2.4 Surprise Fees Are Prohibited

The price you see is the price you pay.

This means:
- No checkout fees added after cart
- No "service fees" that appear at payment
- No shipping estimates that double at checkout
- No currency conversion hidden margins

If our cost increases unexpectedly (customs, carrier surcharges), we absorb it unless it would cause a loss, in which case we contact you before charging.

---

## 2.5 Designer Royalties

### How Royalties Work

For each STL sale:
1. Customer pays listed price
2. Payment processor takes 2.9% + $0.30
3. Remaining amount is "net sale price"
4. Designer receives 70% of net
5. Platform retains 30% of net

Example: $10 STL sale
- Payment processing: $0.59
- Net: $9.41
- Designer: $6.59
- Platform: $2.82

### Payment Schedule

- Royalties accumulate in designer account
- Payouts processed monthly on the 15th
- Minimum payout threshold: $25 CAD
- Balances under threshold roll over (no expiration)
- Designers can request manual payout for balances over $100

### Payment Methods

- PayPal (available at launch)
- Direct deposit (Canadian banks, coming Q2 2026)
- Additional methods based on demand

Payment method fees (if any) are documented and deducted from payout, not added to threshold.

---

## 2.6 Why We Discourage Dependency

A healthy business should not require customers to stay trapped.

We actively encourage:
- Users buying their own printers when volume justifies it
- Designers selling on multiple platforms
- Users learning enough to make informed decisions

This reduces our short-term revenue. We believe it improves long-term sustainability because:
- Customers who stay choose to stay
- Designers who list with us want to list with us
- Word of mouth is stronger than lock-in
- Regulatory risk is lower without anti-competitive practices

We would rather have 1,000 customers who choose us over 10,000 who feel stuck.

---

## 2.7 Margin Philosophy

### What Margins Pay For

Our margin is not profit extraction. It funds:

| Category | Approximate Allocation |
|----------|----------------------|
| Infrastructure | 25% |
| Payment processing | 15% |
| Support and operations | 30% |
| Development and improvement | 20% |
| Reserve and contingency | 10% |

### Margin Commitments

- We will not raise margins to fund aggressive growth
- We will not raise margins to fund acquisition of competitors
- We will reduce margins if operating efficiency improves significantly
- We will be transparent when margin changes are necessary

### Profitability Approach

The goal is sustainable profitability, not maximum extraction.

A healthy 3D3D:
- Pays bills on time
- Pays designers on time
- Maintains reserves
- Invests in improvement
- Provides founder compensation proportionate to contribution

We are not building for a liquidity event. We are building for longevity.

# Section 3: Brand-Games Canon & Expansion

## Purpose

Brand-Games is not a marketing gimmick. It is a long-term system designed to bridge imagination and making, reduce creative friction, and build community engagement through ethical play.

This document establishes the canonical structure, psychological grounding, and expansion rules for Brand-Games.

---

## 3.1 Why Play Belongs in Making

### The Creative Friction Problem

Most people approaching 3D printing face the same moment:

"I could make anything. What should I make?"

This freedom is paralyzing. The blank canvas problem. Without constraints, many people make nothing.

### How Games Solve This

Games provide:
- **Constraints**: Boundaries focus creativity instead of diffusing it
- **Permission**: A prompt gives you license to try something specific
- **Low stakes**: If the result is bad, you were just playing
- **Direction**: Forward motion even when inspiration is absent

This is not manipulation. This is scaffolding.

### Psychological Grounding

Research consistently shows:
- Constraints improve creative output (Green and Kaufman, 2015)
- Play reduces fear of failure (Brown, 2009)
- Gamification increases engagement when non-exploitative (Deterding, 2012)
- Creative prompts outperform open-ended ideation (Baer, 1998)

Brand-Games applies these findings to making.

---

## 3.2 Canonical Game Definitions

### Maker's Quest

**Status**: In Development (Target: Q2 2026)  
**Format**: 20-minute browser-based narrative experience  
**Players**: Single player

**Description**:
You are a traveling artisan in a world where creation is currency. Villages need tools, heroes need weapons, inventors need prototypes. Your journey presents choices that shape your final creation.

**Gameplay Structure**:
1. Choose your archetype (Helper, Inventor, Artist)
2. Travel through three narrative encounters
3. Each encounter presents a design challenge with multiple solutions
4. Choices accumulate into a final design brief
5. At journey's end, receive a printable STL matching your path

**Educational Purpose**:
- Teaches design thinking through story
- Demonstrates how constraints shape outcomes
- Connects abstract decisions to physical objects

**What This Is Not**:
- Not a skill game with scores
- Not a social competition
- Not a monetization funnel
- Not a retention mechanic

**Success Metric**: Players report feeling they made a meaningful creative choice, regardless of print completion.

---

### Trade Show Challenge

**Status**: In Development (Target: Q2 2026)  
**Format**: 30-minute live event format  
**Players**: 3-20 participants

**Description**:
A design sprint format for maker events, conventions, and community gatherings. Participants receive randomized constraints and compete to create the most compelling design concept within time limits.

**Event Structure**:
1. Constraint reveal (random or themed)
2. Individual ideation (10 minutes)
3. Sketch/prototype creation (15 minutes)
4. Presentations (1 minute each)
5. Community voting
6. Awards (Most Creative, Most Practical, Best Story)

**Materials Provided**:
- Constraint card deck (physical or digital)
- Timer synchronization
- Voting mechanism
- Judging criteria

**Educational Purpose**:
- Practices rapid ideation
- Builds community connections
- Demonstrates variety of approaches to same problem

**What This Is Not**:
- Not a platform-monetized competition
- Not a data harvesting opportunity
- Not a sales funnel

**Success Metric**: Participants report enjoyment and intention to make something new.

---

### Creative Challenge Generator

**Status**: LIVE  
**Format**: Instant single-use prompts  
**Players**: Single user

**Description**:
Press a button. Get a creative constraint. Make something. No accounts, no tracking, no ulterior motive.

**Current Prompt Categories**:
- Functional objects with constraints
- Gifts for specific recipients
- Solutions to everyday problems
- Design exercises with limitations

**Technical Implementation**:
- Client-side randomization (no tracking)
- No user identification
- No session persistence
- No analytics beyond aggregate page views

**Educational Purpose**:
- Unblocks stuck makers
- Provides immediate direction
- Demonstrates constraint-as-enabler

**What This Is Not**:
- Not a data collection mechanism
- Not a lead generation tool
- Not a gamified engagement trap

**Success Metric**: Existence is success. No measurement of user behavior.

---

## 3.3 LIVE vs FUTURE Labeling Rules

All Brand-Games content must be clearly labeled:

**LIVE** — Feature is fully functional and available to all users  
**COMING [QUARTER YEAR]** — Feature is in active development with target date  
**CONCEPT** — Feature is designed but not scheduled for implementation

Labels must be:
- Visible without scrolling
- Updated within 7 days of status change
- Removed entirely if abandoned (not left as "delayed")

---

## 3.4 Prohibited Patterns

Brand-Games explicitly rejects:

### Engagement Manipulation
- No streaks that punish missed days
- No countdown timers creating false urgency
- No notifications designed to re-engage lapsed users
- No progress bars that never complete

### Monetization Traps
- No "energy" or "tokens" that deplete
- No premium currencies
- No loot boxes or randomized purchases
- No pay-to-win mechanics

### Social Exploitation
- No forced social sharing for progression
- No leaderboards designed to create anxiety
- No "challenges" that require purchasing to complete
- No friend spam mechanics

### Data Extraction
- No behavioral tracking beyond aggregate analytics
- No user profiles built from gameplay
- No targeting based on game engagement
- No data sales from game interactions

---

## 3.5 Expansion Philosophy

Future Brand-Games development follows these principles:

**Educational Value First**: Every game must teach something about making, design, or the creative process.

**Opt-In Only**: No game mechanics integrated into core platform functions. Games are separate, chosen experiences.

**Complete Without Purchase**: No game progression requires purchasing platform services.

**Honest About Purpose**: If a game promotes the platform, that is disclosed. If a game is pure entertainment, that is disclosed.

**Removable Without Loss**: Users who never touch Brand-Games lose nothing of core platform functionality.

---

# Section 4: Store Education Layer

## Purpose

Before you buy anything from the 3D3D store, you should understand what you're buying, why you might want it, and when you definitely don't need it.

This is buyer protection, not sales copy.

---

## 4.1 STL Purchase vs Print Service

### What You Get With an STL Purchase

When you buy an STL file, you receive:
- A digital file (or files) describing a 3D object
- A license to use that file according to stated terms
- Access to re-download the file from your account
- No physical object

You do NOT receive:
- A physical print
- Ownership of the design itself (copyright remains with creator)
- Unlimited rights (rights are defined by license)
- Guaranteed printability on your specific equipment

### What You Get With Print Service

When you order a print, you receive:
- A physical object manufactured by our network
- Quality control verification before shipping
- Packaging and delivery
- Support if something goes wrong in transit

You do NOT receive:
- The digital design file
- Rights to reproduce the object
- Commercial use rights (unless separately purchased)

### Which Should You Choose?

**Choose STL if:**
- You own a 3D printer
- You want to make modifications
- You plan to print it multiple times
- You want to control the printing process

**Choose Print Service if:**
- You don't own a 3D printer
- You want a single print done well
- You need materials or quality beyond home printing
- Your time is more valuable than the service premium

**Choose Neither if:**
- A manufactured alternative exists and meets your needs
- The object is safety-critical
- You need it faster than either option allows

---

## 4.2 What Commercial Rights Actually Mean

"Commercial license" is frequently misunderstood.

### What Commercial Rights Include

A commercial license typically allows you to:
- Sell physical prints of the design
- Use prints in products you manufacture
- Create marketing materials featuring the print

### What Commercial Rights Usually Exclude

Even with commercial rights, you usually cannot:
- Redistribute the digital file itself
- Sublicense the design to others
- Claim you designed it
- Modify and sell the modified design (unless explicitly permitted)

### Reading the Actual License

Every listing states its license terms. The common types:

**Personal Use Only**
- Print for yourself or as gifts
- Cannot sell prints
- Cannot use commercially

**Commercial Use Included**
- All personal use rights
- Can sell prints
- May have quantity limits
- Cannot redistribute file

**Full Commercial**
- All commercial use rights
- May allow modifications
- May allow sublicensing
- Read specific terms carefully

**When In Doubt**
- Contact the designer
- Do not assume rights not explicitly granted
- "I didn't know" is not a defense

---

## 4.3 When NOT to Buy an STL

### You Don't Own a Printer

Buying an STL without printing capability means:
- You're buying a file you cannot use
- You'll need to pay separately for printing
- Total cost may exceed buying a print directly

Exception: You're planning to buy a printer soon and want to have files ready.

### You'll Only Print Once

If you need exactly one of something:
- Print service may be cheaper than:
  - STL purchase + your materials + your time
- Quality may be higher from a print service
- Failed prints cost you; failed service prints don't

Calculate the real cost, not just the STL price.

### The Design Isn't What You Need

Before purchasing, verify:
- Dimensions match your requirements
- Complexity matches your printer's capability
- Material recommendations match your available materials
- Functional requirements are actually met

Returns on digital goods are complicated. Be certain before buying.

### Better Alternatives Exist

Not everything should be 3D printed. Consider:
- Is there a manufactured version that's cheaper and stronger?
- Is this a safety application where certification matters?
- Is this a commodity item where printing makes no sense?

3D printing is a tool. It's not always the right tool.

---

## 4.4 When Printing Locally Is Better Than Ordering

### Iteration Speed

If you're prototyping:
- Print, test, modify, repeat
- Each cycle on a service adds days
- Local printing: minutes to hours between iterations

### Customization

If you need to modify:
- Local printing lets you change settings per print
- Services print to standard specifications
- Experimentation is free when you own the printer

### Learning

If you're developing skills:
- Failed prints teach you
- Service prints don't
- Equipment ownership builds understanding

### Volume Over Time

If you print regularly:
- Equipment cost amortizes over prints
- Material cost is lower than service cost-per-print
- Independence has value

---

## 4.5 What We Will Never Sell

### Infringing Content

We do not sell:
- Designs that copy trademarked characters without license
- Designs that copy copyrighted works without permission
- Designs uploaded without creator consent

We remove content when infringement is identified.

### Weapons

We do not sell:
- Firearm components
- Weapon accessories
- Designs whose primary purpose is harm

Gray areas are resolved conservatively.

### Unsafe Items

We do not sell:
- Medical devices requiring certification
- Child safety items requiring testing
- Electrical components requiring rating
- Any item where failure could cause serious harm

When in doubt, we don't list it.

### Misleading Items

We do not sell:
- Designs with false capability claims
- Designs with misleading images
- Designs marketed with unverifiable claims

Quality control exists. It's imperfect but intentional.

---

# Section 5: User Trust Guarantees

## Purpose

This section documents specific commitments to users. These are not aspirations. They are guarantees against which platform behavior can be measured.

---

## 5.1 What 3D3D Will Never Do

### Sell Your Data

User data is used to provide service. It is not sold to:
- Advertisers
- Data brokers
- Marketing companies
- Any third party for any purpose

Aggregated, anonymized statistics may be shared. Individual user data is not for sale.

### Trap You

We will not:
- Make account deletion difficult
- Make data export onerous
- Hide cancellation options
- Impose unexpected penalties for leaving
- Hold your content hostage

Your account, your data, your choice.

### Deceive You

We will not:
- Show fake reviews
- Display fake popularity metrics
- Create artificial urgency
- Make unsubstantiated claims
- Use bait-and-switch pricing

If we say something, it's true. If we're uncertain, we say we're uncertain.

### Exploit Designers

We will not:
- Reduce revenue shares without notice
- Prioritize platform content over designer content without disclosure
- Create exclusive arrangements that prevent designers from selling elsewhere
- Use designer content to train AI without explicit consent
- Take ownership of designs uploaded to the platform

Designers are partners, not resources.

---

## 5.2 What You Can Rely On Staying Stable

### Core Functionality

- Account creation and management
- File upload for print quotes
- Quote generation and ordering
- Order tracking and history
- STL purchase and download

These functions remain available as long as the platform operates.

### Your Data

- Order history stays accessible
- Account data exportable on request
- No expiration of purchased content access

### Pricing Model

- Print service pricing structure (material + time + margin)
- Designer revenue share (70/30 split or better)
- No hidden fees policy

Specific prices change with costs. The model stays stable.

### Rights

- Data export right
- Account deletion right
- Right to contact support
- Right to dispute resolution

---

## 5.3 What Changes Require Notice

| Change Type | Notice Period |
|-------------|---------------|
| Price increases for existing services | 30 days |

| Privacy Policy changes | 30 days |
| Feature removal | 90 days |
| Designer revenue share reduction | 60 days |
| Account policy changes | 30 days |
| Governance document changes | 60 days |

Notice means:
- Email to affected accounts
- In-platform notification
- Public announcement on status page
- Clear explanation of what is changing and why

---

## 5.4 Rights You Retain If You Leave

- No fee for data export

### Your Purchased Items

- STL files you purchased remain downloadable for 90 days after account closure
- You should download before closing if you want to retain them
- After 90 days, we have no obligation to provide access of
- We will not sell repurchase of files you already bought

### Your Account

- Closed accounts can be reopened within 90 days
- After 90 days, account data is deleted
- Reopening restores purchase history but not uploaded content

---

## 5.5 Enforcement

These guarantees are enforceable through:

1. **Direct complaint**: governance@3d3d.ca
2. **Response timeline**: Acknowledgment within 48 hours, substantive response within 10 business days
3. **Escalation**: If unsatisfied, users may escalate to relevant regulatory bodies
4. **Cooperation**: We cooperate with regulatory inquiries
5. **Documentation**: All complaints and resolutions are documented

Violation of these guarantees is a governance failure. We take it seriously.

---

# Section 6: Phase 2 Readiness Declaration

## What Phase 2 Unlocks

Phase 2 completion establishes 3D3D as a platform with:

**Governance Foundation**
- Published, enforceable operating constraints
- Clear decision authority and accountability
- Amendment procedures with notice requirements
- Transparent enforcement mechanisms

**Economic Clarity**
- Documented revenue model with no hidden streams
- Published margin allocation
- Designer compensation structure that cannot silently worsen
- Prohibition on surprise fees and deceptive pricing

**Educational Authority**
- Comprehensive learning resources
- Buyer protection through clear explanations
- Store education layer that discourages inappropriate purchases
- Brand-Games as legitimate creative scaffolding

**Trust Infrastructure**
- Explicit guarantees users can rely on
- Published constraints on platform behavior
- Notice requirements for material changes
- User rights that persist beyond active use

---

## What Phase 2 Explicitly Does Not Include

### Aggressive Marketing

We are not launching:
- Paid acquisition campaigns
- Influencer partnerships
- Growth hacking experiments
- Referral mechanics

Growth comes from value delivered, not promotion.

### New Revenue Streams

We are not introducing:
- Advertising
- Premium tiers with locked features
- Subscription requirements for basic use
- Data monetization

Revenue continues from print services and STL sales.

### Platform Expansion

We are not building:
- Mobile applications
- Social features
- Marketplace expansion beyond Canada
- Hardware products

Focus remains on doing one thing well.

### AI Features

We are not implementing:
- AI-generated designs
- AI customer service
- AI content moderation
- AI pricing optimization

Automation exists where it improves service. AI hype is rejected.

---

## What Growth We Intentionally Reject

### Venture-Scale Growth

We are not pursuing:
- Exponential user acquisition
- Market dominance
- Competitive elimination
- Blitzscaling

We are pursuing sustainability at current or modestly growing scale.

### Growth That Degrades Quality

We will not:
- Expand faster than quality control can maintain
- Add makers faster than vetting allows
- Accept orders we cannot fulfill well
- Prioritize revenue over service quality

Saying no to growth is sometimes the right decision.

### Growth Through Lock-In

We will not:
- Create switching costs to retain users
- Make the platform progressively harder to leave
- Build features that only work inside our ecosystem
- Penalize users for using competitors

If users stay, they stay because we're good.

## Why This Pace Is Intentional

### Sustainability Over Scale

Platforms that grow faster than their foundations can support tend to:
- Cut corners on quality
- Compromise values for metrics
- Accumulate technical and cultural debt
- Eventually disappoint users who believed early promises

We would rather be small and excellent than large and mediocre.

### Trust Compounds Slowly

Trust is built through consistent behavior over time. Rushing undermines this:
- Fast promises create expectation debt
- Rapid changes create whiplash
- Quick fixes create fragility
- Growth pressure creates compromises

We are playing a long game.

### This Is a Business, Not a Startup

Startups optimize for exits. Businesses optimize for operations.

We are building:
- Steady revenue with reasonable margins
- Consistent service quality
- Long-term relationships with users and designers
- A platform that can exist for decades

The timeline is decades, not quarters.

## Phase 2 Status

Phase 2 foundation is complete.

The platform now has:
- Published governance structure
- Published economic transparency
- Published user guarantees
- Complete Brand-Games canon
- Complete store education layer
- Complete trust infrastructure

This does not mean the platform is finished. It means the foundation is laid.

Future phases build on this foundation. They do not replace it.
