## 1. Purpose & Scope

This policy governs the handling of print requests, intellectual property considerations, and enforcement procedures for 3D3D Canada Inc. ("3D3D" or "the Company").

### 1.1 Scope of Services

3D3D operates two legally distinct service categories:

**(a) STL Commerce (Digital Product Sales)**

The sale of digital 3D model files (STL format) through the 3D3D Store. These files are:
- Designed by 3D3D
- Licensed to 3D3D by third-party designers under commercial terms
- Offered for free under permissive licenses (e.g., CC BY, CC0, public domain)

When a customer purchases a file from the 3D3D STL Store, they receive commercial printing rights as specified in the product license.

**(b) Print-as-a-Service (Manufacturing Services)**

The manufacturing of physical objects from user-provided digital files. In this capacity, 3D3D:
- Provides access to printing equipment
- Supplies materials (filament, resin)
- Provides labor and quality assurance
- Does not claim ownership of user-provided files
- Does not license, resell, or redistribute user-provided files

This service is comparable to a commercial print shop or copying service.

### 1.2 Governed Parties

This policy applies to:
- All employees and contractors of 3D3D
- Automated systems that process print requests
- Third-party service providers acting on behalf of 3D3D

---

## 2. Definitions

**User-Provided File**  
A digital 3D model file (e.g., STL, 3MF) uploaded by a customer for manufacturing through the Print-as-a-Service offering. Ownership and licensing responsibility rests with the user.

**3D3D STL**  
A digital 3D model file sold through the 3D3D Store, for which 3D3D holds ownership, licensing rights, or permissive redistribution rights.

**Print-as-a-Service**  
The manufacturing service in which 3D3D produces physical objects from user-provided files. 3D3D acts as a manufacturer, not a licensor or distributor of the design.

**Designer Opt-Out**  
A formal request by a designer to have their work blocked from being printed through the Print-as-a-Service offering. This is a good-faith mechanism, not a guarantee of absolute prevention.

**Prohibited Print**  
A print request that the Company refuses to fulfill based on the criteria set forth in Section 4 of this policy.

**Good-Faith Review**  
A reasonable, proportionate effort to assess a concern or complaint without conducting exhaustive verification of every file processed.

## 3. Acceptable Printing Criteria

The following categories of print requests are acceptable:

1. **User-Provided Files with Rights Affirmation**  
   Files uploaded by users who have confirmed, through the required acknowledgement checkbox, that they have the legal right to have the file printed.

2. **Files Purchased from the 3D3D STL Store**  
   Files for which the customer has obtained commercial printing rights through a valid purchase.

3. **Free and Open-License Files**  
   Files released under permissive licenses (e.g., CC BY, CC0, MIT, public domain) that permit commercial printing.

   - Personal projects

---

The following categories of print requests are prohibited:

1. **Files Without Rights**  
   Files for which the user does not have legal authority to print, including designs obtained without the creator's permission.

   Files licensed for personal use only, or non-commercial use only, when the intended use is commercial and no appropriate license has been obtained.

3. **Known Pirated Sources**  
   Files identified as originating from repositories, websites, or sources known to distribute pirated or unauthorized content, when such origin is reasonably identifiable.

4. **Illegal or Prohibited Items**  
   - Weapons, weapon components, or firearm accessories
   - Drug paraphernalia
   - Items prohibited under Canadian federal or provincial law
   - Items requiring regulatory approval that has not been obtained

## 5. Designer Opt-Out Program

### 5.1 Request Submission

Designers may request that their work be excluded from the Print-as-a-Service offering by submitting a request to: designers@3d3d.ca

The request must include:

- Designer contact details
- Design identifiers provided
- Date of request

### 5.3 Enforcement

Opt-out enforcement is applied on a reasonable, good-faith basis. 3D3D does not guarantee absolute prevention of all potential infringements, as:

- Appeal a decision by contacting legal@3d3d.ca

## 6. Review & Flagging Process

### 6.1 No Automated License Verification

3D3D does not inspect, scan, or verify the licensing status of every user-provided file. This policy reflects operational practicality and privacy considerations.

### 6.2 Triggers for Review

Files or orders may be flagged for manual review when:
- A complaint is received from a designer or rights holder
- A report is submitted by a user or third party
- Obvious indicators suggest prohibited content (e.g., file names, keywords, metadata)
- The user has a history of flagged requests
- Order volume or pattern suggests commercial infringement activity

### 6.3 Staff Actions Checklist

When a file is flagged:
1. Document the flag reason and source
2. Review the file name, metadata, and any attached information
3. Cross-reference against the Designer Opt-Out database
4. Consult the Prohibited Printing Criteria (Section 4)
5. Determine disposition: Approve, Refuse, or Escalate
6. Document decision with timestamp and staff identifier
7. Notify user if order is refused (see Section 9)

### 6.4 Documentation Requirements

All review actions must be logged with:
- Date and time
- Staff identifier
- File/order reference
