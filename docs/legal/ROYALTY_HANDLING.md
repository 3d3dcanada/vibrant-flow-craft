## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the royalty and compensation model for designers whose work is sold through the 3D3D Store or its community sections. This policy applies to both STL file sales and suggested contributions on community-sourced designs.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

1. **3D3D Store Purchases** — Digital files (STL) sold through the official store
2. **Community Section Contributions** — Files shared with optional royalty participation
3. **Print-as-Service** — User-uploaded files do NOT generate royalties (users own their files)

---

## 3. Royalty Model

### 3.1 STL Store Purchases

When a customer purchases an STL file from the 3D3D Store:

- The designer receives compensation as specified in their agreement with 3D3D
- Standard split: 70% to designer, 30% to platform (negotiable for volume creators)
- Payments are processed monthly for balances exceeding $25 CAD
- Designers must provide valid payment information

### 3.2 Suggested Community Royalty

For files in the community section where designers have opted into the royalty program:

- **Suggested contribution:** CAD $0.25 per print sale
- This is **voluntary** — not enforced by technical means
- Customers are informed of the contribution but not required to participate
- Designers who opt in acknowledge the voluntary nature

### 3.3 Unclaimed Royalties

If royalty payments are collected but remain unclaimed by the designer:

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 0-12 months | Funds held in trust for the designer |
| After 12 months | Funds are distributed as follows: |
|  | • 50% donated to a registered Canadian charity supporting maker education |
|  | • 50% allocated to community workshops, events, or educational initiatives |

### 3.4 Opt-Out Mechanism

Designers may:

- Decline participation in royalty collection entirely
- Remove their work from the community section
- Request that their designs not be printed through the service (see PRINTING_POLICY.md)

---

## 4. No Guarantees

3D3D does not guarantee:

- A minimum number of sales or prints
- A minimum royalty amount
- Collection of voluntary contributions from customers
- Enforcement of suggested royalty rates

The royalty system is a good-faith mechanism to compensate creators, not a contractual guarantee of income.

---

## 5. Record-Keeping

All royalty transactions are:

- Logged with date, amount, and recipient category
- Available for audit upon request by the designer (for their own earnings)
- Subject to annual reconciliation
- Retained for 7 years per Canadian tax requirements

---

## 6. Payment Methods

Royalty payments are issued via:

- Interac e-Transfer (preferred for Canadian residents)
- Platform credits (at designer's request)
- Other methods as mutually agreed

Minimum payout threshold: $25 CAD

---

## 7. Tax Responsibilities

Designers are responsible for:

- Reporting royalty income to relevant tax authorities
- Providing accurate tax information (e.g., SIN for Canadian residents, if required)
- Compliance with all applicable tax laws

3D3D may issue T4A slips for Canadian designers earning above CRA thresholds.

---

## 8. Amendments

Changes to this policy:

- Require 30 days notice to active royalty participants
- Will be communicated via email and platform notification
- Do not apply retroactively to existing agreements
