# STL Commerce Philosophy

**Internal Document — Also Publicly Referenced**

## Purpose

This document explains how 3D3D approaches STL commerce — the selling and distribution of digital design files. It is intended for designers considering listing with us, users evaluating purchases, and legal/compliance reviewers assessing our model.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Ownership vs. Access: We're Clear About the Difference

When you buy an STL from 3D3D, you receive:
- **A license to use the file** according to stated terms
- **Not ownership of the design itself** — the designer retains copyright

This distinction matters. You're buying permission, not property. The license defines what you can do. If the license says "personal use only," that's what you have. If it says "commercial rights included," you can sell prints.

We state licensing terms clearly on every product page. No guessing required.

### 2. Commercial Rights: What "Clear Rights" Actually Means

Many platforms leave commercial rights ambiguous. We don't.

For **3D3D-owned designs** (created by us or purchased for our catalog):
- You receive full commercial print rights upon purchase
- No royalties, no usage limits, no reporting requirements
- Sell prints however you want, wherever you want
- The only restriction: you can't redistribute the file itself

For **community-sourced designs** (from partnered designers):
- Commercial rights are explicitly stated per listing
- If commercial rights aren't granted, the listing says so clearly
- Designers set their own terms; we enforce them

We refuse to carry designs with ambiguous licensing. If a designer can't clearly define what rights you're getting, we don't list the file.

### 3. Voluntary Royalties: Why They Exist

Some community designs on our platform are offered for free or low cost. We include an optional royalty contribution.

**How it works:**
- Suggested contribution: $0.25 per commercial print sale
- Completely optional — no tracking, no enforcement
- Contributions go to the original designer (or our workshop fund if unclaimed)

**Why we do this:**
- Some designers want low-barrier distribution while still earning from commercial success
- It creates a culture of reciprocity without legal complexity
- It respects that designers invest real time creating free things

**Why it's optional:**
- Mandating royalties on voluntary contributions defeats the purpose
- We trust the community more than surveillance systems
- Enforcement mechanisms create their own costs and conflicts

This is a social contract, not a legal one.

## What We Won't Do

### We Don't Inspect Your Prints

We sell you the file. What you do with it after is between you and the license terms. We're not:
- Tracking how many prints you sell
- Monitoring where you sell them
- Auditing your Etsy store
- Demanding compliance reports

This isn't because we don't care about designer rights. It's because surveillance-based enforcement doesn't scale, creates privacy issues, and poisons community trust.

### We Don't Claim Your Designs

If you list a design with us:
- You keep full ownership
- We get only the rights needed to display and sell it
- You can remove it anytime
- We don't use your work for our own purposes without explicit agreement

Read our Designer Bill of Rights for the complete picture.

### We Don't Race to the Bottom

We refuse to:
- Encourage pricing wars between designers
- Feature "cheapest" sort options prominently
- Pit creators against each other for visibility
- Algorithmically favor low prices over quality

Some platforms optimize for transaction volume. We optimize for ecosystem health.

## Why 3D3D Discourages Dependency

It might seem strange for a store to say this, but: we want you to eventually not need us for STL files.

Our ideal customer journey:
1. You start by downloading files from us
2. You learn what makes a good design
3. You start modifying and creating
4. Eventually, you design your own files — or collaborate directly with designers

We're here to provide access. But the long-term goal is capability. A customer who becomes a creator is a success, not a loss.

---

## Price Transparency

Every listing shows:
- Total price (what you pay)
- Designer share (what goes to the creator)
- Platform share (what 3D3D keeps)

No hidden fees. No checkout surprises. If the price is $8, you pay $8.

---

## Quality Standards

We don't accept every file. Listings must:
- Be printable without extreme difficulty
- Include accurate print specifications
- Have clear images showing the actual print, not renders
- Not infringe third-party IP (to our knowledge after reasonable review)

This isn't a platform for dumping random STLs. Curation exists.

---

## Designer Compensation

For sales through our store:
- Designer receives 70% of net revenue
- Platform retains 30% for operations, infrastructure, support
- Payments processed monthly for accounts over $25 balance
- No hidden deductions or fees from designer share

This split is competitive with major marketplaces while providing services most don't (print service integration, local maker network, community features).
