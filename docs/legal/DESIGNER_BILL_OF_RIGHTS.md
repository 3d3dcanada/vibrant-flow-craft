# Designer Bill of Rights

**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Jurisdiction:** Canada (Federal + Provincial)

---

## Preamble

Designers are the foundation of the 3D printing ecosystem. Without people who create, share, and sell digital designs, platforms like 3D3D would have no purpose.

This document establishes the rights that designers can expect when interacting with our platform. These are not aspirations — they are commitments.

---

## Article 1: Right to Ownership

**Your work belongs to you.**

- Uploading a file to 3D3D does not transfer ownership
- We claim no rights to your designs beyond what's necessary to fulfill services you request
- You retain all copyrights, trademarks, and moral rights to your creations
- We will never sell, license, or distribute your designs without explicit permission

---

## Article 2: Right to Compensation

**You deserve to be paid fairly for your work.**

- When your designs are sold through our platform, you receive 70% of net revenue
- Royalty structures are disclosed clearly before you participate
- Payment timelines are predictable and documented
- We do not take hidden fees from designer earnings
- You may request a detailed breakdown of any payment at any time

---

## Article 3: Right to Control

**You decide how your work is used.**

- You may restrict your designs to personal use, commercial use, or specific applications
- You may request removal of your work from our platform at any time
- Removal requests are honored within 72 hours for active listings
- You may opt out of specific programs (royalty pooling, promotional features, etc.)
- Our controls for licensing are simple and accessible, not buried in settings

---

## Article 4: Right to Protection

**We actively protect your interests.**

- We refuse to knowingly print designs that infringe your rights
- We maintain a designer opt-out registry for creators who don't want their work printed
- We respond to takedown requests within documented timeframes
- We cooperate with legitimate legal enforcement against infringement
- We do not require you to prove ownership — we give the benefit of the doubt to creators

---

## Article 5: Right to Transparency

**You see what we see.**

- Download counts, revenue, and usage statistics are available to you
- We explain how discovery and ranking work on our platform
- We disclose our algorithms' impact on your visibility when asked
- Changes to policies that affect you are announced with advance notice
- You may request an export of all data we hold about you and your designs

---

## Article 6: Right to Non-Exploitation

**We will not exploit your work or position.**

- We will not use your designs to train AI models without explicit consent
- We will not use your presence to attract users while paying you nothing
- We will not pit designers against each other in a race to the bottom
- We will not favor certain designers algorithmically without disclosure
- We will not take advantage of power imbalances between platform and creator

---

## Article 7: Right to Exit

**You can leave with your work intact.**

- All your designs can be removed upon request
- No artificial barriers prevent you from leaving
- We do not own exclusive rights to anything you create
- Your reputation and reviews remain yours (we don't erase history punitively)
- Departing designers receive a complete data export within 30 days

---

## Article 8: Right to Due Process

**Disputes are resolved fairly.**

- Accusations require evidence before action
- You have the right to respond before designs are removed (except clear legal violations)
- Appeal processes exist and are documented
- Decisions are made by humans, not algorithms alone
- Repeat violation policies are clearly stated and consistently applied

---

## Article 9: Right to Community

**You are part of something, not just a supplier.**

- Designer feedback influences platform development
- We maintain channels for designer communication and support
- Educational resources help designers succeed
- We celebrate and promote designer achievements
- Community decisions are made with designer input

---

## Article 10: Right to Information

**You understand what you're agreeing to.**

- Terms of service are written in plain language
- Policy changes are explained, not just announced
- Legal jargon is minimized and defined when used
- You can ask questions and receive understandable answers
- Important decisions require explicit consent, not buried checkboxes

---

## Enforcement

Violations of these rights may be reported to:  
**designer-rights@3d3d.ca**

Reports receive acknowledgment within 48 hours and substantive response within 5 business days.

Documented violations will be:
1. Investigated by a designated staff member (not the accused party)
2. Resolved with explanation to the affected designer
3. Logged for pattern analysis
4. Addressed systemically if patterns emerge

---

## Amendments
