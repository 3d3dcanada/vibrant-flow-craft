## Purpose

This document establishes the ethical principles that guide every decision at 3D3D. It is not marketing copy. It is a binding internal standard that informs product development, policy creation, and daily operations.

We publish this document publicly because accountability requires visibility.

## Core Principles

### 1. Honesty Over Growth

We will not sacrifice truthfulness for user acquisition, engagement metrics, or revenue.

**This means:**
- No fake statistics or inflated claims
- No testimonials we cannot verify
- No features advertised before they function
- No dark patterns designed to manipulate behavior
- No vanity metrics presented as meaningful data

**We will not:**
- Display "X users online" counters that are fabricated
- Show fake "limited time" offers that reset
- Use countdown timers designed to create false urgency
- Pre-check boxes for marketing consent
- Make unsubscribing harder than subscribing

### 2. User Independence Over Platform Lock-In

Our goal is to make users capable, not dependent.

**This means:**
- Actively educating users about 3D printing so they can make informed choices
- Recommending printer ownership when it makes sense for the user
- Never designing features that trap users in our ecosystem
- Making data export easy and complete
- Not penalizing users for reducing their usage

**We will not:**
- Create artificial switching costs
- Withhold information that would help users succeed independently
- Design addiction mechanics into our platform
- Treat user dependency as a success metric

### 3. Designer Respect Over Platform Revenue

Designers create the value that makes platforms like ours possible. We will not exploit them.

**This means:**
- Fair, transparent royalty structures
- Clear communication about how files are used
- Opt-out mechanisms that actually work
- No claiming rights to user-uploaded content
- No using uploaded files to train AI models without explicit consent

**We will not:**
- Bury designer rights in terms of service
- Take royalty percentages that make creation unsustainable
- Pretend uploaded files are our property
- Pit designers against each other in races to the bottom

### 4. Transparency Over Convenience

When transparency is inconvenient for us, we choose transparency anyway.

**This means:**
- Publishing our platform fees clearly
- Explaining how pricing works
- Documenting our policies publicly
- Admitting mistakes publicly when we make them
- Explaining why we make controversial decisions

**We will not:**
- Hide fees until checkout
- Obscure how much makers earn
- Keep policies private when they affect users
- Pretend problems don't exist

### 5. Safety Over Speed

We will not ship features that compromise user safety to meet deadlines.

**This means:**
- Thorough testing before launch
- Security reviews for sensitive features
- Privacy by design, not privacy as an afterthought
- Compliance with Canadian privacy law without seeking loopholes

**We will not:**
- Launch payment features without proper security review
- Collect data we don't need
- Share user data with third parties for profit
- Treat privacy as a feature to be traded away
