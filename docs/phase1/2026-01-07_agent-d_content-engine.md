# 3D3D.ca Deep Education Content Engine

## Hard Rules

❌ We do not sell products  
❌ We do not hide pain points  
❌ We do not pretend printers "just work"  
❌ No affiliate links  
❌ No "Top 10 Best Printers to Buy"  
❌ No content written just to rank  

✅ Turn frustration into understanding  
✅ Turn confusion into confidence  
✅ Turn failure into shared learning  
✅ Turn curiosity into habit

## Core Philosophy

### Psychological Principles (Intentional, Not Manipulative)

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Cognitive chunking | Short sections, visual anchors |
| Progress visibility | "You are here" cues |
| Relief framing | "You're not stupid, this is normal" |
| Problem-first narratives | Pain before solution |
| Intermittent reward | Credits, badges, recognition |
| Permission to skim | TL;DRs, callouts |
| Pattern recognition | Repeatable frameworks |

**No manipulation. No dark patterns. Respect for ADHD brains.**

---

## Content Structure Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Every article MUST include:

```
1. TL;DR at top
2. Why this is frustrating
3. Why it happens
4. What people usually try (and why it fails)
5. What actually works
6. What to try next
7. When to stop and ask for help
```

Plus:
- Visual dividers every 2–3 paragraphs
- Bullet points > walls of text
- Plain language first, technical depth second
- "Stop here if overwhelmed" sections

### 🔥 Top 10 Printers People Struggle With

**Framing**: These printers are popular because they're affordable or accessible—not because users are dumb.

## High-Leverage Features

### Print Readiness Score (Educational)

**Not a grade. A learning checklist.**

```
Your file's readiness:

✅ Manifold geometry
✅ Correct scale (mm)
⚠️ Thin walls detected (may break)
⚠️ Overhangs > 45° (supports recommended)
❌ Non-printable regions

📚 Learn why: [Link to each issue article]
```

### Maker Notes (Gold)

Short explanations from real makers attached to orders:

```
"This part failed first attempt because the 
bridge section was too wide. I split it into 
two prints and it came out perfectly."
— Sarah, Fredericton Maker
```

**Effect**: Builds massive trust through real expertise.

### Printer Reality Index

**Not rankings. "Common struggles per printer."**

| Printer | Common Issues | Fixability | Worth Fixing? |
|---------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Ender 3 v2 | Bed leveling, thermal runaway | High | Yes, if patient |
| Bambu A1 Mini | Cloud dependency, ecosystem lock | Low | Accept or switch |
