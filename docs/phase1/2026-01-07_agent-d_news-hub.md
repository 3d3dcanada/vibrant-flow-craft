# 3D3D News & Trust Hub

**Goal**: Become Canada's #1 source for 3D printing news, education, and trust.  
**Competitors to beat**: Tom's Hardware, All3DP, 3DPrint.com  
**Differentiator**: Local-first, consumer-education, community-driven, trust density over volume

## 🔴 CRITICAL POLICIES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Editorial Safety & Defamation Policy

**3D3D does not accuse specific sellers, brands, or individuals of fraud unless:**

1. Evidence is documented and verifiable
2. Claims are framed as **risk indicators**, not allegations
3. Language is **comparative and educational**, not accusatory

**We NEVER imply:**
- ❌ Criminal intent
- ❌ Illegal behavior
- ❌ Deliberate deception

**We ALWAYS frame as:**
- ✅ Observed patterns
- ✅ Consumer risk factors
- ✅ Quality indicators
- ✅ Educational comparisons

**Required Language Shifts:**

| ❌ DON'T Write | ✅ DO Write |
|----------------|-------------|
| "Etsy's Dirty Secret" | "Common Issues Buyers Encounter on Large Marketplaces" |
| "Temu 3D Prints Are Unsafe" | "Why Ultra-Low-Cost 3D Prints May Carry Higher Risk" |
| "Amazon FBA Prints Are Junk" | "Quality Considerations When Buying 3D Prints Online" |
| "Sellers Are Scamming You" | "Risk Factors to Watch for When Purchasing 3D Prints" |
| "The Handmade Lie" | "Understanding 'Handmade' Labels on Marketplace Platforms" |

---

### Source Attribution & Fair Use Policy

**When referencing Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Discord, etc.:**

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Summarize | Do not republish full content |
| Quote minimally | Use excerpts only, always attribute |
| No screenshots | Unless fair-use excerpts with attribution |
| Link to originals | When possible and appropriate |
| No endorsement claims | Never imply affiliation |

**Protection against:**
- DMCA complaints
- Platform takedowns
- "Content scraping" accusations

---

### Safety & Liability Disclaimers

**Standard disclaimer for ALL technical articles:**

```
⚠️ DISCLAIMER
This content is for educational purposes only.
3D printing involves heat, electricity, fumes, and moving parts.
Always follow manufacturer guidelines and local safety regulations.
3D3D is not responsible for any damage or injury resulting from
the application of information in this article.
```

**Additional disclaimers when applicable:**
- Material safety (resin toxicity, ABS fumes)
- Electrical work (firmware, hardware modifications)
- Food safety (not FDA/Health Canada approved unless stated)
- Child safety (toy regulations, small parts)

---

### Human Editorial Oversight Statement

**"All editorial content is reviewed by a human before publication."**

If this is not yet true, we:
- Limit claims about editorial quality
- Mark AI-assisted content clearly
- Prioritize human review for legal-risk content

---

## Content Tiering & Velocity (Realistic)

**We beat Tom's Hardware by TRUST DENSITY, not volume.**

| Tier | Type | Volume | Quality Bar |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Tier 1** | Breaking News | 3–5 / week | Short, factual, sourced |
| **Tier 2** | Analysis / Consumer Education | 2–3 / week | High quality, well-researched |
| **Tier 3** | Deep Dives | 1 / week | Extremely high, long-term tested |

**Total: 6–9 articles/week (sustainable, not burnout)**

---

## Canadian Data Usage Policy (Competitive Advantage)

### New Pillar: "Real Canadian Data"

**This is how we beat All3DP — data they can't fake.**

| Data Type | Example | Source Label |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Print failures | "Top 5 print failures Canadian makers see in winter" | "Based on anonymized data from active Canadian 3D3D makers" |
| Material usage | "Most popular materials in Canada this month" | "Based on [X] prints completed in Canada" |
| Regional patterns | "Humidity vs print quality: Canadian data" | "Based on maker reports from [X] provinces" |
| Turnaround times | "Average turnaround by province" | "Based on [X] completed orders" |

**Rules:**
- Always label data source clearly
- Anonymize individual maker data
- Update monthly with real numbers
- Never extrapolate beyond what data supports

---

## ADHD Engagement (Deeper)

### A. "Read in 60 Seconds" Blocks

At top of every long article:

**Three Things to Know**:
1. [Point 1]
2. [Point 2]
3. [Point 3]

**Read deeper ↓** or **[Take action now →](/quote)**
```

### B. Visual Rhythm Pattern

- Section headers every 150–200 words
- Alternating: text → bullets → image → checklist
- No "wall of text" sections

### C. End-of-Article Choice (Two CTAs)

```markdown

## Pillar: Marketplace Awareness (Legally Safe)

### Visual Guide: Quality Indicators

**Indicators of Higher-Quality 3D Prints:**
- ✅ Clean layer lines (proper print settings)
- ✅ Consistent color (quality filament)
- ✅ Flat base (proper bed preparation)
- ✅ No stringing (tuned retraction)
- ✅ Neutral or mild PLA scent (standard materials)
- ✅ Appropriate weight (structural integrity)
- ✅ Maker attribution (accountability)

**Risk Factors That May Indicate Lower Quality:**
- ⚠️ Visible layer lines (may indicate rushed printing)
- ⚠️ Inconsistent color (may indicate variable filament quality)
- ⚠️ Warping/curling (may indicate adhesion issues)
- ⚠️ Stringing between parts (may indicate lack of quality control)
- ⚠️ Strong chemical odor (may warrant material safety questions)
- ⚠️ Unusually light weight (may indicate thin walls/low infill)
- ⚠️ No maker information (limits accountability)

**Framing**: Observations, not accusations.
